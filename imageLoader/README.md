# Lightbox Viewer

This program is written to experiment with how react/redux work. A boilerplate was used to setup the initial environment (create-react-app).

This program accepts user input for a photoset ID that it then uses to retrieve the photoset using the flickr **flickr.photosets.getPhotos** api. 

Once a photoset is retrieved, it can be viewed again until another photoset is called/searched for.

In order to build and run this app. Make sure you have npm (package manager for JS) installed on your machine. cd to the directory of the project, and run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Enjoy!
