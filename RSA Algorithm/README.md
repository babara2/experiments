# RSA Algorithm #

RSA algorithm is a public-key encryption algorithm that is used to have secure communications that are very unlikely to be intercepted by a third party. The RSA algorithm is not only elegant but also very powerful so much so that it is relevant today despite having been conceived in the 1970s when computational power of machines was low. Today Elliptic curve cryptography is the state of the art public-key cryptography system offering same level of security while using much smaller keys. Despite that RSA is the most widely used algorithm for public-key encryption and digital signatures.

This program was written for fun as an addendum to a presentation we were giving on encryption methods for our Coding Theory class. We went into detail about how RSA worked so we thought making a program would be a fun demonstration of its functionality. Nothing special.
